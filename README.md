# WEB103 Prework - *CreatorVerse*

Submitted by: **Nour Siwar**

About this web app: **A person's top content creators can say a lot about them. Do they prefer lockpicking videos 🔒, casual art streams 🖼️, or hustle-culture TikTokers 📱?**

Time spent: **4** hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **A logical component structure in React is used to create the frontend of the app**
- [X] **At least five content creators are displayed on the homepage of the app**
- [X] **Each content creator item includes their name, a link to their channel/page, and a short description of their content**
- [X] **API calls use the async/await design pattern via Axios or fetch()**
- [X] **Clicking on a content creator item takes the user to their details page, which includes their name, url, and description**
- [X] **Each content creator has their own unique URL**
- [X] **The user can edit a content creator to change their name, url, or description**
- [X] **The user can delete a content creator**
- [X] **The user can add a new content creator by entering a name, url, or description and then it is displayed on the homepage**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Picocss is used to style HTML elements
- [X] The content creator items are displayed in a creative format, like cards instead of a list
- [X] An image of each content creator is shown on their content creator card

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] It's a backend feature but I used a new IDE called **Web Storm**, which is part of JetBrains package. It's nicer than VS Code to do web development in.

## Notes

- Some challenges I encountered were mainly setting up the project using the new IDE I've never used before called **Web Storm**, but the project was easy for me as I took WEB 102 and have already done this project in that class.
